Preply,"This job is what you make of it, which can be great and awful altogether.","You can set your own availability and price, but your hours might not fill up or fill up with unpaid trial lessons, and for normal lessons, they take a decent cut of your price per lesson. With over 4 years on the site, it has been delightful to see it grow but it really is a site built for the students, not the teachers. A prospective student could book a trial lesson without having talked to you, not respond to any messages you send before the trial lesson, and then demand large asks during the unpaid trial lesson. Some students are absolutely great as well, but you don't get much information beforehand so it's a gamble. You can choose who you continue to teach after the trial lesson, they've also added a block button against students (finally after two years). They penalize you if you cancel a lesson, especially trial lessons. You can attempt to contact the student to change the time but if they don't respond you're stuck.  Once you have some established students you can make your account unavailable to new students, which is a great feature otherwise half your day could be trial lessons. I have some students that I've seen weekly for 3+ years and the site is great for the longstanding student-tutor relations. The support staff is international, the company is Ukrainian, and they respond fairly quickly depending on your time zone. The site has its own video platform, which is always being developed.

Preply,The best job I ever had!,The most flexible and best paid job I ever had by far!  I work completely remotely from home and work as much as I want and I totally manage my times as I want. Payment is absolutely great there are just some very small adjustments I would like to see: Students shouldn’t be able to cancel their class for free on the same day - this makes it absolutely impossible for me to plan my day and I have to open my calendar from 2pm - 2am even tho I have a lot of free slots in between because so many students cancel their classes last minute. I would highly recommend a cancellation policy like booking.com has it: Cancel 24h before - 25%  12h before - 50% 8h before - 100% Other then that I am quiet fine but I would like to her a small bonus when I work a lot of hours and already paid Preply more than 300$ of commission for a week - for example they could do it like this: The first 20 hours a week are the regular 18% commission - the next 10 hours are with 16% commission and everything more than 30 hours are just 12% commission- with that Preply would become more attractive as a full time job.
