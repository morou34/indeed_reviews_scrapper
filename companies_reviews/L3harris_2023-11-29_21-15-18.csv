,"Overall, I would have to give it a pluses over minuses review. These days,  it is tough to find that happily ever after for Engineers","What is the best part of working at the company? Flexibility for working hours as long as you get good work accomplished and help to move the business forward.  L3 Harris has good people at the worker bee level and that makes it worth it. What is the most stressful part about working at the company? Managerial pressure to perform is such that any period where there is a lack of work on your plate, where IDL (Indirect Labor- overhead) is charged, gives you the impression that you might be canned at the next business down-turn. What is the work environment and culture like at the company? In general, good.  Again, the working people mostly are good but the managerial level and the constant emphasis on positive c ash flow is stressful.",2023-11-29,"Palm Bay, FL",Sr. Mechanical Engineer,Current Employee,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,

,No upward mobility,"Without a degree, you are unable to move up in the company. Before L3 Technologies merged with Harris, things were much different. They would pay for you to go to college with almost no limit to how much they would pay for. Now its very limited. If you want to grow in this company, you must get a college degree.",2023-11-26,"Slc, UT",Government Property Administrator,Former Employee,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,
,The good hybrid schedule and lots of help but you have to ask for it.,Culture is very dry. You probably won’t make any friends here. The pay and pto is better than most companies. There aren’t too many incentives like pharmaceutical industry. It’s a good stepping stone but most people leave after a few years.,2023-11-21,Sr. Associate,Sr. Associate,Current Employee,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,Work/life balance,"No bonus, no perks, boring atmosphere"
,A great place to grow a young career,"Plan on 50+ hour workweeks.  60 is appreciated.  PTO is ""unlimited"" but you'll never take all 160 hrs and you don't get paid for unused.  ""Off"" fridays mean you get to work from home.  Lots of talented, dedicated folks - just be prepared to dedicate yourself and work the long hours.  Some positions have paid overtime, so there's money to be made.  Defense contracting takes some getting used to if you're from the private sector.  Little incentive for efficiency.  Lots of very rigid, defined processes.  Can feel like it's impossible to get things done.  LOTS of turnover means there's opportunity for advancement, and also stress and inefficiency.  Very conformist environment.  Great parental leave policy, but 60 hr weeks don't allow much time with the baby after that.",2023-11-20,"Northampton, MA",Engineer,Former Employee,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,"Money, talented co-workers",60 hr work weeks
,Satisfaction Depends on Factors,"Very cliquey. Lots of turnover happens. Satisfaction depends on what group you are in. It also depends on what projects you are assigned. In my case, my management stays off my case. However, I don’t get assigned the more “interesting” projects. I was on a horrible project for a very long time.",2023-11-18,"Greenville, TX",Software Engineer,Current Employee,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,,

,work there only if you dodn't care for your career and pay,Bad culture and non-appreciative leadership.  Very hard to recognize people even for small things. Work-life balance is okay though. 9/80 schedule which gives you every other Friday off Variable compensation (annual bonus) is reserved only for higher grades,2023-11-17,"Rochester, NY",Electrical Engineering Manager,Former Employee,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,
